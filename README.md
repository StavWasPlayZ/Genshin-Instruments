**PLEASE ONLY COMMIT TO THE [DEV BRANCH](https://github.com/StavWasPlayZ/Even-More-Instruments/tree/dev)!**

## Language Contributions
Want your own language to be available for this mod? Well, I most likely can't speak it; but I bet you can!  
I do not restrict any one language from being available on my mods, so if you find yours to be unpresent - feel free to attach them in a PR!

The primary, most up-to-date English lang file can be [found here](https://github.com/StavWasPlayZ/Genshin-Instruments/blob/dev/src/main/resources/assets/genshinstrument/lang/en_us.json).

Thank you for your help in localization!

## GitHub Issues
GitHub Issues may be used for both reporting any bugs, and suggesting new content!

### Reporting Bugs
It's very common I do an oopsie while I code.  
For most developers too.  
If you observe a wrong behavior and believe I am at fault, feel free to compose a bug report!  

I would appreciate reports that state more than _"My game crashed!"_, but rather, what you *did* to achieve such a state.

**MAKE SURE TO ATTACH YOUR FULL `debug.log`/`latest.log`, REGARDLESS OF THE BUG TYPE!**  
Online tutorials for how to retrieve one are present online.

## Feature Suggestions
**I will not be accepting any new instruments!** _(besides Genshin ones if they are
yet to be implemented ig.)_  
Such suggestions should be directed to the [Even More Instruments](https://github.com/StavWasPlayZ/Even-More-Instruments/) project.

Anything else, i.e API & QoL stuff - do feel free!

## Code Contributions
A few points to take in mind before committing:
- New features should first be [suggested as an issue](https://github.com/StavWasPlayZ/Genshin-Instruments/issues)
  before being put into production.
- **I will not be accepting any new instruments!** _(besides Genshin ones if they are
  yet to be implemented ig.)_  
  Such contributions should be directed to the [Even More Instruments](https://github.com/StavWasPlayZ/Even-More-Instruments/) project.
- Contributions should keep in mind the regular Java conventions,
  as well as my own code practices, to better match with the codebase.  
  If you're unsure - it's always best to just scan the codebase first.
- I am a solo dev here, so reviewing foreign code may take me some more time (and skepticism).

## Why won't he respond to my query??
GitHub has 1 dire issue: that I for some reason, sometimes, don't get notified one new
issues/PRs being made.  
If you notice a lack of response, please DM me in CurseForge and I'll be sure to be present!
