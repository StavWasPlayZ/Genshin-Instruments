2) You are using the *latest version* of this mod. You may check on either Modrinth or CurseForge what the latest release number is, and clarify if it matches the one that appears in your Mod list.
3) The issue's title contains the Minecraft version you wish to report.
  - If you know this bug occurs on multiple Minecraft versions, use a range (1.19.2 - 1.20.1) or a list (1.19.2, 1.20, 1.20.1, etc.) instead of a single version. Check said versions before doing so.
