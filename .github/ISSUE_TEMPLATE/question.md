I wanted to make this like a funny template but istg i just looked up "meaning of life" in Google and Wikipedia out here spittin facts:

> The meaning of life is "freedom from suffering" through apatheia (Gr: απαθεια), that is, being objective and having "clear judgement"

...now that i think about it it kinda does make sense-
well done, joke ruined ತ⁠_⁠ʖ⁠ತ


Anyways, refrain from asking stuff like this but rather things that are actually related to the project lol
